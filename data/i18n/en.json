When capital is low, increasing turnover by trading multiple times helps accumulate large profits. As weapon levels increase, upgrade costs increase exponentially, so selling at appropriate levels early on is good.",
          "When capital is sufficient, consider investing in premium weapons. Premium weapons have high initial costs but large selling price increases when upgraded, allowing larger long-term profits. Especially weapons at level 5 or higher have greatly increased selling prices, so when some capital accumulates, establish strategies centered on premium weapons.",
          "It's important to calculate the ratio of upgrade costs to selling prices to find highly profitable moments. If the cost to raise a weapon one more level is greater than the selling price increase, selling at that point is rational. You can determine optimal selling moments through simple math calculations.",
          "Resource management is key. Rather than blindly raising levels, it's important to create the most efficient investment plan with currently held funds. Focusing on one weapon to quickly create a high level then selling is also effective, rather than managing multiple weapons simultaneously."

A single stone alone isn't a threat, but when two or more are connected, the danger level increases significantly.",
          "Create attack patterns like 3-3 and 4-4, but if your opponent blocks them, use that to develop attacks in other directions - this is advanced strategy. Rather than focusing on one place, the key is to create simultaneous threats in multiple places, making it difficult for your opponent to defend. Also, launching additional attacks near your opponent's stones that block your 3 or 4 enables chain attacks.",
          "The balance between defense and offense is important. If you only block your opponent's attacks, you'll eventually fail to block one place and lose. Active defense is needed - blocking your opponent's threats while simultaneously creating your own attack opportunities. By placing a stone at a position your opponent must block, you can develop attacks elsewhere while they block that spot.",
