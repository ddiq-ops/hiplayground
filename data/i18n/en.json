          "In the early stages, it's key to collect energy by manual clicking first, then quickly purchase automatic production upgrades. Buying cheap automatic upgrades like AA Battery or Home Server first will increase your production per second, allowing energy to continue increasing without manual clicking.",
          "Since upgrade costs increase by 1.25x with each purchase, it's more advantageous in the long run to balance multiple upgrades rather than focusing on just one. For example, it's good to level up Power Glove to about level 5, then switch to automatic production upgrades.",
          "In Time Attack mode, securing fast early production is important. Prioritize early automatic production upgrades, and when you have some room, also level up manual click bonus upgrades.",
          "In Time Limit mode, you need to collect as much energy as possible within 3 minutes, so a balanced upgrade strategy is needed. Since time is limited, it's more effective to buy several reasonably priced upgrades rather than expensive ones."

Through fast clicking and strategic upgrade purchases to efficiently collect energy, you can improve your brain's agility and decision-making abilities. In particular, you can develop logical thinking through resource management strategies using the automatic production system, and feel a sense of achievement through goal setting and achievement. With simple controls that are fun to play, it's an educational game that anyone from elementary school students to adults can easily access."
