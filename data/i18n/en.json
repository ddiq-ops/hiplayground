          "Since upgrade costs increase by 1.25x with each purchase, it's more advantageous in the long run to balance multiple upgrades rather than focusing on just one. For example, it's good to level up Power Glove to about level 5, then switch to automatic production upgrades.",
          "In Time Attack mode, securing fast early production is important. Prioritize early automatic production upgrades, and when you have some room, also level up manual click bonus upgrades.",
          "In Time Limit mode, you need to collect as much energy as possible within 3 minutes, so a balanced upgrade strategy is needed. Since time is limited, it's more effective to buy several reasonably priced upgrades rather than expensive ones."

For example, in multiplication problems with large numbers, you can infer the answer by checking the last digit. Also, when dividing by 2 or multiplying by 5, you can quickly find the answer by checking only the last digit.",

When capital is low, increasing turnover by trading multiple times helps accumulate large profits. As weapon levels increase, upgrade costs increase exponentially, so selling at appropriate levels early on is good.",
          "When capital is sufficient, consider investing in premium weapons. Premium weapons have high initial costs but large selling price increases when upgraded, allowing larger long-term profits. Especially weapons at level 5 or higher have greatly increased selling prices, so when some capital accumulates, establish strategies centered on premium weapons.",
          "It's important to calculate the ratio of upgrade costs to selling prices to find highly profitable moments. If the cost to raise a weapon one more level is greater than the selling price increase, selling at that point is rational. You can determine optimal selling moments through simple math calculations.",
          "Resource management is key. Rather than blindly raising levels, it's important to create the most efficient investment plan with currently held funds. Focusing on one weapon to quickly create a high level then selling is also effective, rather than managing multiple weapons simultaneously."

          "It's good to focus on the center area of the board in the early stages. Starting from the center allows you to create attack paths in all directions, which is advantageous. Also, it's important to place your stones around your opponent's stones to create attack opportunities while also defending. A single stone alone isn't a threat, but when two or more are connected, the danger level increases significantly.",
          "Create attack patterns like 3-3 and 4-4, but if your opponent blocks them, use that to develop attacks in other directions - this is advanced strategy. Rather than focusing on one place, the key is to create simultaneous threats in multiple places, making it difficult for your opponent to defend. Also, launching additional attacks near your opponent's stones that block your 3 or 4 enables chain attacks.",
          "The balance between defense and offense is important. If you only block your opponent's attacks, you'll eventually fail to block one place and lose. Active defense is needed - blocking your opponent's threats while simultaneously creating your own attack opportunities. By placing a stone at a position your opponent must block, you can develop attacks elsewhere while they block that spot.",
          "Learning endgame techniques is important for improving win rate. When you have 4 stones in a row with one end blocked, you can win by placing at the other end. It's important to learn these basic endgame patterns and not miss such opportunities during the game."

Don't raise your wrists too high and maintain a natural posture, which helps with long play sessions.",

Especially when consecutive notes appear, it's important to maintain rhythm and press keys at consistent intervals.",
          "Maintaining combos is key to high scores. Missing judgment breaks your combo and loses bonus points, so it's important to press keys at accurate timing rather than uncertain notes.

If there are many enemies, choose area attack weapons (Garlic Aura, Rotating Axe), and if a boss appears, choose powerful single-target weapons (Lightning).

Production lines automatically generate gold, so the game progresses without clicking, but you can earn additional gold by actively clicking or investing, allowing you to enjoy various play styles. As stages increase, goal amounts increase exponentially, providing challenging difficulty, and especially Stages 26-30 require optimized strategy and patience due to nearly impossible difficulty.

          "Think about piece harmony. Each piece must work together. Knights are powerful when combined with bishops, and rooks and queens are effective on open files. Don't isolate pieces; position them to support each other.",
          "Secure your King's safety. In the opening, castle to protect your King. Maintain pawn structure in front of the King for defense. In the endgame, the King can be used offensively, but always prioritize safety.",
          "Minimize mistakes and understand the AI's weaknesses. The AI isn't perfect and can make slight mistakes. Observe the AI's attack patterns and recognize recurring sequences to find counter-strategies. It's more important to play practical, solid moves than to calculate deeply."

        "description": "Chess Master: Hell Mode is a chess game that pushes strategic thinking and planning abilities to the extreme. This game pits you against grandmaster-level AI from Round 1, providing a very challenging experience for elementary school students. Through the Positional Tactics (PST) system, the AI accurately evaluates each piece's positional value to find optimal moves. The game helps improve logical thinking, pattern recognition, and long-term planning skills, while fostering a growth mindset of learning from failures. The challenge of clearing all 12 rounds develops perseverance and patience, and the ability to solve complex problems step by step. Chess is a strategic board game with thousands of years of history, scientifically proven to enhance brain development and cognitive abilities."

          "Attacking the base support first is effective. Removing the bottom part of the box tower causes the upper boxes to collapse, removing many boxes in a chain reaction. Especially hitting the center-bottom part of the tower makes the entire structure unstable, dealing great damage.",
          "Adjust the ball's angle and force carefully. Since you can preview the trajectory, it's important to find the angle that can accurately hit the target point. Shooting at an angle close to horizontal can effectively attack the bottom, and shooting at a high angle can hit the top. Practice finding the optimal launch angle for each stage's structure.",
          "Utilize chain reactions. To remove as many boxes as possible with one ball, you must consider the physics effects of boxes colliding and falling. Accurately hitting a specific point to induce a chain collapse can remove many boxes with few balls.",
          "It's important to conserve balls. The fewer balls remaining, the greater the pressure, so it's good to make sure hits in the early stages. Also, finding the weak parts of the box tower and focusing your attack is efficient."

Through the game, you can intuitively understand basic physics concepts such as angles, force, and trajectory, and naturally learn about the principles of object motion and collision. It improves visual problem-solving abilities along with strategic thinking, and trains spatial perception and prediction abilities. By observing object movements similar to reality through the game's physics engine, it stimulates scientific curiosity and develops a learning attitude through experimentation and observation. It's a highly educational game that helps increase elementary school students' scientific thinking and interest in physics."
